Snake game
It is a game where player controls a thin and long creature that looks like a snake which can roams around on a bordered plane. The primary goal in the snake game is for players to collect as many apples as possible while avoiding collisions with both the walls and the snake's own body. As snake eats the apple it gets longer and longer where the play got to avoid hitting the snake itself as well as the walls around.
To go with my pygame the provided Python script comprises a basic Snake game.
It defines two classes, SNAKE and FRUIT, along with corresponding test classes, TestSNAKE, and TestFRUIT.
In the SNAKE class, the init method initializes the snake with a body represented as a list of Vector2 objects and a direction specified as a Vector2 object. The new_block attribute is initially set to False. The draw_snake and move_snake methods serve as placeholders for the code responsible for rendering and moving the snake on the screen, respectively. The add_block method sets new_block to True, indicating the need to add a new block to the snake. The reset method resets the snake to its initial state.
The TestSNAKE class functions as a unit test for the SNAKE class, specifically testing the add_block and reset methods.
The FRUIT class represents the game's fruit and has an init method for initializing the fruit with a random position. The draw_fruit method is a placeholder for the code responsible for rendering the fruit on the screen, while the randomize method sets the fruit's position to a random location within the game grid.
The TestFRUIT class acts as a unit test for the FRUIT class, focusing on testing the randomize method.
The script concludes with a call to unittest.main(), triggering the execution of all tests.
